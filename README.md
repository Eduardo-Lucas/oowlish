# Managing Customers
## The task at hand:
- Create a simple Django REST API which provides information about customers.

- Create two extra fields for latitude and, longitude and, fill them up by customer's address using any 
 Geolocation API
- Implement a REST API with two endpoints: one for listing all customers and, another one for getting
a single customer by its id 
- Create a simple web page to consume the REST API (you can use auto-documentation like djangoyasg);
S. 
- Write README.md instructions on how to get your code up-and-running;
